# Hello! I'm Audrey Norris

### Software Developer | Project Manager | Esports Caster

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an adaptable programmer with 6 years of experience building projects through school and professional work. I blend technical expertise with project management skills to deliver exceptional products for clients and their users.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the mic as an esports shoutcaster or speaking at events. **Communication and collaboration are at the heart of everything I do.**
